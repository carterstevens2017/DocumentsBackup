ECE471 Fall 2015 -- HW7

Name:

4. Describe your something cool:
	For my something cool, I had the temperature sensor take a 15 second sample, printing the temperature in degrees celsius every
second. At the end of that 15 second period, the minimum temperature, maximum temperature, and average temperature would be printed
to the screen.



5. a. The anti-lock brake system on a car would be considered a hard real-time task. If the anti-lock brakes take too long to engage,
	then a collision could occur, causing injuries or death.
   b. The tune button on a car radio would be a soft real-time constraint because even if the deadline is missed, the information or action
	is still relevant and usable, it might just be a mild inconvenience.
   c. The video player presents a firm real-time task because if a frame deadline is missed, the video will be glitchy or slow, making it
	useless to the viewer.
   d. One thing that is a disadvantage of SPI compared to I2C is the fact that SPI can run a shorter distance than I2c.
   e. No, I would not use this sensor unless there was an op amp in the system because the resistance of the wire will create a voltage
	drop across the wire that would make the information much less reliable.

6. a. If you pipe a command to /dev/null, the information is essentially nullified and thrown away.
   b. If you pipe a command to /dev/full, it will not accept the command because there is no space left for it.
   c. You could use /dev/zero for debugging to see if you get the expected results.
   d. /dev/random contains random numbers
