Name: Carter Stevens


What you did for something cool (if applicable): Implemented for loops to create a constant "SOS" signal with my LED


Answers to Question #5:

a.It is better to use udelay() rather than a busy loop because it saves energy rather than using the processor during
	the whole delay, and the C compiler can sometimes optimize the code, making the timing irregular and hard to 
	specify.

b.An operating system helps when programming GPIOs due to the fact that it eliminates a lot of tedious steps such as
	selecting the GPIO clock, setting the clock speed, and reading and writing to registers in seperate instructions.
	Also, the OS can handle the updated bitfields so the user does not have to shift or mask the registers.

c.Many of the aspects of the operating systems that make them so convenient are also the same aspects that impose
	limitations. Using the operating system you can't access the clocks to modify them to specific frequencies 
	like you could if you were writing directly to the hardware. 

d.Yes, I would consider a web browser to be part of an operating system because takes care of many of the finer details
	of navigating the internet for you, making it much more user friendly.

Answers to Question #6:

a. Machine type:Raspberry Pi 2 Model B

b. Kernel version:Linux raspberrypi 3.18.7-v7+

c. Free Disk space:3.6G

d. -h in the instruction df -h makes the data output human readable
