ECE471 HW5 -- Fall 2015

Name:


6.	Describe what your "something cool" code does

	My "something cool" takes my initials, CAS, and "drops" them into the LED display,
	meaning that the bottom part of the letters are shown at the top of each segment which
	"decends" from off screen at the top to off screen on the bottom.

7.
 a).	Our raspberry pi's use a SoC, or more specifically the Broadcom BCM2835.
	This is used for video encoding and decoding, and imaging. The digital signal
	processing core handles the initial boot before handing control over to the ARM
	processor. Most ARM boards do not have their boot on external memory.
 
b).	The boot loader is responsible for finishing the initial boot and loading the
	operating system into memory on start up or reboot.
	
c).	The /boot partition on the Pi is a FAT32 filesystem because it is simple, low memory,
	works on most machines, and has no patents on it. Also, the firmware is smart enough
	to load it.

8.
 a).	My display_final.c program has 91 lines in it.

 b).	The size difference between display_final.c and display_test.c is 66 lines.
