ECE 471 Fall 2014 -- Homework 3

Name:Carter Stevens

Answer to Question #3a:	

print_number:
	push	{r10,LR}	// Stores the LR address in r10
        ldr	r10,=buffer	// Renames LR address as "buffer"
        add	r10,r10,#10	// Moves the address of buffer 10 bytes

divide:
	mov	r1,#10		// Assigns r1 the value of 10

	bl	divide_by_10	// Links to program divide_by_10
	add	r8,r8,#0x30	// Increases value of r8 by 38 bytes
	strb	r8,[r10],#-1	// Post-index loads byte from r10 to r8 then subtracts 1
	adds	r0,r7,#0	//adds r7 to r0 and sets flags
	bne	divide		//if zero flag is off, branch to divide

write_out:
        add	r1,r10,#1	//increases buffer by 1 and sets to r1

        bl	print_string	//branches to print_string to print number

        pop	{r10,LR}	//sets LR to original address

        mov	pc,lr		//sets pc to lr address

Answer to Question #6:

a. Hello_world.extra has a size of 644 bytes while hello_world.thumb has a smaller size of 612 bytes

b. hello_world from hw 2 has a size of 3.088 Kb

c. We would definitely use assembly in a space constrained system because it took up only 1/5 of the size of the c code

d. The c code is much easier to write because of the way multiple operations can be done in one line, due to the higher level

Answer to Question #7a:In September 1752 the British Empire switched from the Julian calendar to the Gregarian calendar. The
			Gregarian calendar was 12 days ahead of the Julian calendar, so those 12 days were ignored but workers
			were paid for a month of work.
