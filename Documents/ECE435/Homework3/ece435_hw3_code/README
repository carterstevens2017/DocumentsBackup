Name: Carter Stevens

Answers to homework questions:

4a. 100Mbps
4b. My ifconfig reads no collisions on sending, no errors, 
	and nearly 600,000 dropped receiving packets

4c. As of right now I only have two devices on my ethernet network,
	my raspberry pi and my router.

6a. 14:08:40.669561 b8:27:eb:a1:7e:a3 (oui Unknown) > 0c:c4:7a:44:ae:b8 (oui Unknown), ethertype IPv4 (0x0800), length 70: 10.70.0.31.55914 > 130.111.19.185.http: Flags [P.], seq 1:5, ack 1, win 229, options [nop,nop,TS val 80347955 ecr 1162766581], length 4

6b. 0c:c4:7a:44:ae:b8 is the MAC address in the source field and it 
	belongs to Super Micro Computer, Inc.

6c. ethertype IPv4 (0x0800)

6d. The ethernet packets have to be a minimum size, so a packet that is
	too small gets stuffed with extra bytes.

7a. Ethernet won out over token ring due to the fact it has better 
	performance and speed while also being the cheaper option.

7b. An ethernet switch knows "who" is connected to each node so
	a packet is sent over the required node, not broadcasted, which
	increases security and reduces collisions.

7c.	Wired ethernet has no wireless interference problems like wifi does.
